Windows Fundmental 3

windows update = provides security updates, feature enhancements, and patches for the window operating system 

access window update through setting or running cmd (control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate)

windows security = virus & threat protection, Firewall & network protection, App & browser control, Device security.

Green = device is sufficiently protected, and there aren't any recommended actions
yellow = safety recommendation for u to review 
red = warning that something needs immediate attention

virus & threat protection = current threats, virus & threat protection settings
---current threats
#############
--scan option
#############
-quick scan = checks folders in your system where threats are commonly found
-full scan = checks all files and running programs on your hard disk. this scan could take longer than one hour
-custom scan = choose which files and locations you want to check
################
--threat history
################ 
-last scan = windows defender antivirus automatically scans your device for viruses and other threats to help keep it safe 
-quarantined threats = have been isolated and prevented from running on your device. periodically removed
-allowed threats = allowed threats are items identified as threats, that were allowed to run on your device.

virus & threat protection settings
-real-time protection = locates and stops malware from installing or running on your device
-cloud-delivered protection = Provides increased and faster protection with access to the latest protection data in the cloud.
-Automatic sample submission = Send sample files to Microsoft to help protect you and others from potential threats. 
-Controlled folder access = Protect files, folders, and memory areas on your device from unauthorized changes by unfriendly applications.
-Exclusions = Windows Defender Antivirus won't scan items that you've excluded.
-Notifications = Windows Defender Antivirus will send notifications with critical information about the health and security of your device. 

virus & threat protection updates = check for updates to update windows defender antivirus definition

ransomware protection = controled folder access =  Ransomware protection requires this feature to be enabled, which in turn requires Real-time protection to be enabled.
-------------------------------|
*******************************|

firewall = controls the traffic that goes in out of the ports

Firewall & network protection = 3 sections = Domain, privat, public
Domain = the profile applies where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller. 
Private = The private profile is a user-assigned profile and is used to designate private or home networks.
Public = The default profile is the public profile, used to designate public networks such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.
NEXT
turn the firewall on/off   and block all incoming connections

##############
TO OPEN WINDOWS FIREWALL IN COMMAND USE WF.msc
##############################################


Microsoft Defender SmartScreen = protects against phishing or malware websites and applications and the downloading of potentially malicious files

checks apps and files = windows defender smartscreen = helps protect your device by checking for unrecognized apps and files from the web.
exploit protection = Exploit protection is built into Windows 10 (and, in our case, Windows Server 2019) to help protect your device against attacks
------------------------

core isolation = Memory Integrity = Prevents attacks from inserting malicious code into high-security processes.

TPM = Trusted Platform Module = provides additional encryption for your device 
it also makes it tamper resistant and malicious software is unable to tamper with the security functions of the tpm
---------------

Bitlocker Drive encryption = is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers

if tpm installed = bitlocker offer best protection

if dont have tpm = USE USB startup key
------------------------------------------
Volume Shadow Copy Service(VSS) = coordinates  the required actions to create a consistent shadow copy (also known as a snapshot or a point-in-time copy) of the data that is to be backed up
they are stored on the system volume info folder on each drive that has protection enabled

if vss in enabled (system protection turn on) you can perform the task in advanced settings
- Create a restore point
- Perform system restore
- Configure restore settings
- Delete restore points

malware writers write code in their malware to loook for these files and delete them within this feature
that way it makes it impossible to recover from ransomware attacks. unless theirs an offline/off site backup

Note: Attackers use built-in Windows tools and utilities in an 
attempt to go undetected within the victim environment.  
This tactic is known as Living Off The Land. Refer to the
