CIA triad = Confidetiality, integretity, availability

confidentiality =  protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse
organizations always have data stored it is there job to protect it

integrity = the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.

Availability = data to be useful it must be available and accessible by the user 
info should be available when authorized users need to access it 

--Having reliable and well-tested hardware for their information technology servers (i.e. reputable servers)
--Having redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
--Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
level of access given to individuals determined by
--The individual's role/function within the organisation
--The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

2 comp are used to assign & manage access rights of individual
--pim = priviledge identity management = translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system
--pam = priviledge access management = management of the privileges a system's access role has

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bell-La Padula Model = confidentiality = organization hierarchical struct, responsibilities /roles defined
 = works by granting access to piece of data (objects) on a sctrict need to know bases 

"no write down no read up"
-----------------------
Biba Model = same as the other one but integrity 
rule of object(data) and subject(user) 
"no write up no read down" = subjects can create or write content to objects at or below their 
level but can only read the contents of objects above the subjects level

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Threat modelling = process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services.
to help with this use framework = STRIDE = Spoofing Tampering with data, Repudiation threats,Information disclosure, Denial of service and Elevation of privilegs
				= PASTA = (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) 

To successfully solve an incident, these steps are often referred to as the six phases of Incident Response that takes place, listed in the table below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tampering

Action		Description

Preparation	Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?
Identification	Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?
Containment	Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?
Eradication	Remove the active threat.
Recovery 	Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.
Lessons Learned	What can be learnt from the incident? I.e. if it was due to a phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails.
