3 ways discovering content on website
	- manually
	- automated
	- OSINT(open source intelligence)
---Manually

or
power shell

Http Headers = when make request to web server, it returns various HTTP headers
MAY contain useful info = webserver software and programming/scripting language in use

curl website_name -v = enable verbose mode, outputs the header 
-------------------------------------
OSINT = 
google hacking/ dorking = google advanced search = allow pick ouut custom content

Wappalyzer
 (https://www.wappalyzer.com/) is an online tool and browser extension 
that helps identify what technologies a website uses, such as frameworks, Content Management Systems (CMS), payment processors and much more, and it can even find version numbers as well.

Wayback Machine

The Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/) is a historical archive of websites that dates back to the late 90s.
 You can search a domain name, and it will show you all the times the service scraped the web page and saved the contents. This service can help uncover 
old pages that may still be active on the current website.

Git = is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project 

s3 Buckets = storage service provided by amazon AWS,  allowing people to save files and even static website content in the cloud accessible over HTTP and HTTPS
owner of file = set permissions sometimes can be set to public
format of the S3 buckets is http(s)://{name}.s3.amazonaws.com where {name} is decided by the owner, such as tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com
---------------------
automated discovery = process of using tools to discover content rather than doing it manually 
automation tools = ex are ffuf, dirb and gobuster
----------
 ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ
--
dirb http://MACHINE_IP/ /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
--
gobuster dir --url http://MACHINE_IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
