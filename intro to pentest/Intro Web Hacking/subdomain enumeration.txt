Subdomain enumeration methods
	- Brute Force
	- OSINT
	- Virtual Host
--------------------
SSL = Secure Sockets Layer
TLS = Transport Layer Security
Certificate Transparency CT logs  = Public accessible logs of SSL/TLS certificate created for domain name

purpose:
TRansparecy logs = stop malicious and accidentally made certificates from being used 

use it to dicover subdomains belonging to domain, sites
 https://crt.sh and https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui
offer searchable database show current and past results

search engines = contain trillions of links to more than billion websites can 
		 be an excellent resource for finding new subdomains 
ex: "-site:www.domain.com site.*.domain.com"  (Use google)
---------------
Bruteforce DNS = enumeration is method of trying tens,hundreds, thousands or even millions of different possible subdomains

requires many request = automate with tools to make it faster

ex: dnsrecon		dnsrecon -t brt -d acmeitsupport.thm
------------
automation using sublist3r
to speed up process OSINT subdomain discovery 
sublist3r
./sublist3r.py -d acmeitsupport.thm  = speed up proccesso of osint subdomain discovery
---------------------
Web servers can host numerous websites from a single server. 
• When a client requests a website, the server determines which website the client wants based on the Host Header.
----
Tool:
• ffuf
It comes pre-installed with Kali Linux
Example: 
• ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://<domain name/ip address>
Switches:
-w > wordlist
-H > adds/edits a header
-u > url
-fs > tells ffuf to ignore any results that are of the specified size

ex 4 fs : ........ -fs 2395
