Metasploit: Meterpeter

Meterpreter =  payload that supports the penetration testing process with many valuable components
	- Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture.

Meterpreter runs on the target system but is not installed on it. It runs in memory and does not write itself to the disk on the target. This feature aims to avoid being detected during antivirus scans. 
By default, most antivirus software will scan new files on the disk (e.g. when you download a file from the internet) Meterpreter runs in memory (RAM - Random Access Memory) to avoid having a file that
has to be written to the disk on the target system (e.g. meterpreter.exe). 
This way, Meterpreter will be seen as a process and not have a file on the target system.



- You will see Meterpreter is running with a process ID (PID) of 1304; this PID will be different in your case
- getpid command, which returns the process ID with which Meterpreter is running.
- all processes running in Linux or Windows will have a unique ID number; this number is used to interact with the process when the need arises (e.g. if it needs to be stopped).

If we list processes running on the target system using the ps command, we see PID 1304 is spoolsv.exe and not Meterpreter.exe, as one might expect.
Even if we were to go a step further and look at DLLs (Dynamic-Link Libraries) used by the Meterpreter process (PID 1304 in this case), we still would not find anything jumping at us (e.g. no meterpreter.dll)
It is also worth noting that Meterpreter will establish an encrypted (TLS) communication channel with the attacker's system.
-----------------------------------------------------
 staged payloads are sent to the target in two steps. An initial part is installed (the stager) and requests the rest of the payload.
- This allows for a smaller initial payload size. The inline payloads are sent in a single step. 
-  Meterpreter payloads are also divided into stagged and inline versions. However, Meterpreter has a wide range of different versions you can choose from based on your target system. 

 available Meterpreter versions could be to list them using msfvenom, as seen below. 

We have used the msfvenom --list payloads command and grepped "meterpreter" payloads (adding | grep meterpreter to the command line)
------------------------------------------------------------
Typing help on any Meterpreter session (shown by meterpreter> at the prompt) will list all available commands.

Meterpreter will provide you with three primary categories of tools;
- Built-in commands
- Meterpreter tools
- Meterpreter scripting


----Core commands
background: 	Backgrounds the current session
exit: 		Terminate the Meterpreter session
guid: 		Get the session GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)
help: 		Displays the help menu
info: 		Displays information about a Post module
irb:		Opens an interactive Ruby shell on the current session
load: 		Loads one or more Meterpreter extensions
migrate: 	Allows you to migrate Meterpreter to another process
run: 		Executes a Meterpreter script or Post module
sessions: 	Quickly switch to another session
------------------------------
File system commands

cd: 	Will change directory
ls: 	Will list files in the current directory (dir will also work)
pwd:	Prints the current working directory
edit: 	will allow you to edit a file
cat: 	Will show the contents of a file to the screen
rm: 	Will delete the specified file
search: Will search for files
upload: Will upload a file or directory
download: Will download a file or directory
-----------------------
Networking commands

arp: 		Displays the host ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache
ifconfig: 	Displays network interfaces available on the target system
netstat: 	Displays the network connections
portfwd: 	Forwards a local port to a remote service
route: 		Allows you to view and modify the routing table
------------------------
System commands

clearev: 	Clears the event logs
execute: 	Executes a command
getpid: 	Shows the current process identifier
getuid: 	Shows the user that Meterpreter is running as
kill: 		Terminates a process
pkill: 		Terminates processes by name
ps: 		Lists running processes
reboot: 	Reboots the remote computer
shell: 		Drops into a system command shell
shutdown: 	Shuts down the remote computer
sysinfo: 	Gets information about the remote system, such as OS
-----------------------------------
Others Commands (these will be listed under different menu categories in the help menu)

idletime: 	Returns the number of seconds the remote user has been idle
keyscan_dump: 	Dumps the keystroke buffer
keyscan_start: 	Starts capturing keystrokes
keyscan_stop: 	Stops capturing keystrokes
screenshare: 	Allows you to watch the remote user's desktop in real time
screenshot: 	Grabs a screenshot of the interactive desktop
record_mic: 	Records audio from the default microphone for X seconds
webcam_chat: 	Starts a video chat
webcam_list: 	Lists webcams
webcam_snap: 	Takes a snapshot from the specified webcam
webcam_stream: 	Plays a video stream from the specified webcam
getsystem: 	Attempts to elevate your privilege to that of local system
hashdump: 	Dumps the contents of the SAM database
-------------------------------------------------------------
The getuid command will display the user with which Meterpreter is currently running. 
 This will give you an idea of your possible privilege level on the target system (e.g. Are you an admin level user like NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or a regular user?)

The ps command will list running processes. The PID column will also give you the PID information you will need to migrate Meterpreter to another process.

Migrate
Migrating to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. 
if you see a word processor running on the target (e.g. word.exe, notepad.exe, etc.), you can migrate to it and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process
Some Meterpreter versions will offer you the keyscan_start, keyscan_stop, and keyscan_dump command options to make Meterpreter act like a keylogger
Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session.

- to migrate to a process, need to type  = migrate pid_num
- you might lose admin priviledge if migrate to a lower user


Hashdump
The hashdump command will list the content of the SAM database.
The SAM (Security Account Manager) database stores user's passwords on Windows systems. These passwords are stored in the NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) format.
can discover the cleartext password using online NTLM databases or a rainbow table attack.
 These hashes can also be used in Pass-the-Hash attacks to authenticate to other systems that these users can access the same network.
----------------
Search
The search command is useful to locate files with potentially juicy information
In a CTF context, this can be used to quickly find a flag or proof file, while in actual penetration testing engagements, you may need to search for user-generated files or configuration files that may contain password or account information.

shell
The shell command will launch a regular command-line shell on the target system. Pressing CTRL+Z will help you go back to the Meterpreter shell.
