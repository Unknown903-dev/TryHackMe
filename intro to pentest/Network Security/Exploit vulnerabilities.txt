Exploit vulnerabilities


Vulnerability scanning
Advantage	Disadvantage
Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease.			People can often become reliant on these tools.
These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.					They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is not good if you are trying to bypass firewalls and the likes.
Open-source solutions exist.											Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.
Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for.	They often do not find every vulnerability on an application.

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning.

Security Misconfigurations	Security misconfigurations involve vulnerabilities that are due to developer oversight. For example, exposing server information in messages between the application and an attacker.
Broken Access Control		This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an application that they are not supposed to be able to otherwise.
Insecure Deserialization	This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, where it will then be executed.
Injection			An Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application. This is due to the failure of not ensuring (known as sanitising) input is not harmful.

Vulnerability capstone

1. run the python3 exploit we found on exploit database and use the website url or ip
2. run nc listener on = nc -lvnp 8080
3. when script is ran, run shell_me and use the machine ip and the same port we used on listener
4. get into the directory
5. cat the file
