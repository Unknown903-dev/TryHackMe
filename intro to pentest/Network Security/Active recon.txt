Active recon
========================================
essential to remember NOT TO ENGAGE in |
active recon work before getting signed|
legal authorization from the client    |
========================================

Active recon = requires you to make some kind of contact with your target
- phone call
- visit to target company = social engineering 
- direct connection to target system = visit website / check firewall have ssh port open


begin with direct connection 
- connecting might leave info in logs showing client ip address, time of connection, and duration of connection, etc ....
- not all are suspicious can connect as client 

by default
- TCP port 80 = HTTP
- TCP port 443 = HTTPS

since default ports arent shown in address bar 
- custom ports can be used to access a service 	



- FoxyProxy lets you quickly change the proxy server you are using to access the target website. This browser extension is convenient when you are using a tool such as Burp Suite or if you need to switch proxy servers regularly. You can get FoxyProxy for Firefox from here.
- User-Agent Switcher and Manager gives you the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different web browser. In other words, you can pretend to be browsing a site using an iPhone when in fact, you are accessing it from Mozilla Firefox. You can download User-Agent Switcher and Manager for Firefox here.
- Wappalyzer provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites. Such extension is handy, primarily when you collect all this information while browsing the website like any other user. A screenshot of Wappalyzer is shown below. You can find Wappalyzer for Firefox here.

ping pong = throw ball expect to get it back

ping = is to check whether you can reach the remote system and that the remote system can reach you back.

ping is a command that sends an ICMP Echo packet to a remote system. If the remote system is online, and the ping packet was correctly routed and not blocked by any firewall, the remote system should send back an ICMP Echo Reply. 
################
ping HOSTNAME  #
################

reasons for no ping reply
- The destination computer is not responsive; possibly still booting up or turned off, or the OS has crashed.
- It is unplugged from the network, or there is a faulty network device across the path.
- A firewall is configured to block such packets. The firewall might be a piece of software running on the system itself or a separate network appliance. Note that MS Windows firewall blocks ping by default.
- Your system is unplugged from the network.

traceroute =  traces the route taken by the packets from your system to another host
- purpose is to find ip address of router or hops that a packet traverses as it goes from your system to a target host
- reveals number of routers between 2 systems 
note: that the route taken by the packets might change as many routers use dynamic routing protocols that adapt to network changes.
########################################
linux / mac os = traceroute ip_address
MS Windows     = tracert ip_address

apt install traceroute = if not installed
########################################

- rely on icmp to trick router to reveal ip_address
- use ttl time to live in ip header field
- TTL indicates the maximum number of routers/hops that a packet can pass through before being dropped
- When a router receives a packet, it decrements the TTL by one before passing it to the next router. statrs with 64
- if ttl reaches 0 -> will be dropped and an icmp ttl exceeded will be sent to origninal sender

hence we want the ttl to reach 0 to recieve ICMP and get a ip Address back

--  12 99.83.69.207 (99.83.69.207) 17.603 ms 15.827 ms 17.351 ms
--  shows the time in milliseconds for each reply to reach our system, line number 12, the twelfth router with the listed IP address has dropped the packet three times and sent an ICMP time exceeded in-transit message
--   two stars in the output 3 * 100.66.16.176 (100.66.16.176) 8.006 ms * indicate that our system didn’t receive two expected ICMP time exceeded in-transit messages.
--   On the other hand, we can see that we received only a single reply on the third line. 

- The number of hops/routers between your system and the target system depends on the time you are running traceroute. There is no guarantee that your packets will always follow the same route, even if you are on the same network or you repeat the traceroute command within a short time.
- Some routers return a public IP address. You might examine a few of these routers based on the scope of the intended penetration testing.
- Some routers don’t return a reply.

TELNET = Teletype Network developed 1969 to communicate with a remote system via command line interface (CLI)

telnet = usese TELNET protocol for remote administration
- default port 23 = sends all data, usernames, passwords in cleartext 
- if have access to communcation channel to steal login credentials 
- relies on TCP protocol, can use telnet to connect to any service and grab banner

##############################
telnet ip_address port
##############################

can connect to any service running on TCP and exchange a few messages unless use encryption

learn more on a web server
- listen on port 80
- then communicate using http protocol 
- issue GET/ HTTP/1.1 or GET / page.html HTTP/1.1
- to get valid responce need to input some value for host: example, hit enter twice 

EX: 
telnet ip_address port_num
then type
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: host_name

when using mail server use proper protocol
- SMTP
- POP3
--------------------------------------------------------

- Netcat supports TCP and UDP
- can function as a client that connects to a listening port 
  it can act as a server that listens on a port of your choice 
----------
- can connect to a server = nc ip_address port
 notes: might need to press SHIFT+ENTER after the GET line.

- You can use netcat to listen on a TCP port and connect to a listening port on another system.
- On the server system, where you want to open a port and listen on it, you can issue nc -lp 1234 or better yet, nc -vnlp 1234

-l	Listen mode
-p	Specify the Port number
-n	Numeric only; no resolution of hostnames via DNS
-v	Verbose output (optional, yet useful to discover any bugs)
-vv	Very Verbose (optional)
-k	Keep listening after client disconnects

-----------------------------
- the option -p should appear just before the port number you want to listen on.
- the option -n will avoid DNS lookups and warnings.
- port numbers less than 1024 require root privileges to listen on.
