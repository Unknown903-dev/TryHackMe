post port scan 

- once nmap discovers open ports can probe available port to detect running service 


- 	-sV 	= collect and determine service and version info for the open ports 
	shows version of each detected services 
	forces nmap to proceed with the tcp 3 wya handshake and establish a connection fully communicating with listening service
- 	-sS is not possible when -sV option is chosen

- 	--version-intensity LEVEL	=  can control the intensity 
	-sV --version-light = has intensity of 2
	-sV --version-all   = has the highest 9
----------------------------------------------------
Os detection	= -O

nmap can detect an OS based on its behaviour and any telltale signs in its response 

nmap -sS -O ip_address

- OS detection is very convenient but many factors might affect its accuraccy 
- nmap needs to find at least one open and closed port on the target to make a reliable guess
- OS fingerprint might get distorted due to rise in virtualization 

Traceroute

-    --traceroute  = if you want nmap to find the routers between you and a target 
-    differ from traceroute or tracert command
     Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.

-    Standard traceroute starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target
-    also there are many routers that are configured not to send icmp TTL exceeded, which can prevent us from discovering the ip    
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- script = code not need to be compile, stays readable form, nor need to be converted to ML
- can add custom functionalitys
- nmap supports scripts = lua language

-   --script=default  or  add -sC  = choose to run script in defaul category 

-------------------------------------------------------
auth		Authentication related scripts
broadcast	Discover hosts by sending broadcast messages
brute		Performs brute-force password auditing against logins
default		Default scripts, same as -sC
discovery	Retrieve accessible information, such as database tables and DNS names
dos		Detects servers vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)
exploit		Attempts to exploit various vulnerable services
external	Checks using a third-party service, such as Geoplugin and Virustotal
fuzzer		Launch fuzzing attacks
intrusive	Intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation
malware		Scans for backdoors
safe		Safe scripts that won’t crash the target
version		Retrieve service versions
vuln		Checks for vulnerabilities or exploit vulnerable services
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-    sudo nmap -sS -sC MACHINE_IP, where -sC will ensure that Nmap will execute the default scripts following the SYN scan.
-    --script "SCRIPT-NAME"   = specify script
-   or a pattern such as --script "ftp*", which would include ftp-brute
-   you might expand the functionality of Nmap beyond the official Nmap scripts; you can write your script or download Nmap scripts from the Internet. Downloading and using a Nmap script from the Internet holds a certain level of risk. So it is a good idea not to run a script from an author you don’t trust.

Three main formats to save and name your file 
- normal 
- grepable 
- XML

script kiddie not recommended
------------------------------------------
normal = scan in normal by -oN file_name

- similar to output you get when scannong a target
----------------------------------------------------
Grepable   = grep stands for global regular expression printer
		makes filtering the scan output for specific key words or terms effecient 
-   grep  = -oG filename
-   ex: grep keyword text_file  will display all lines containing keyword
---------------------------------------
XML  =   save results =  -oX file_name
 	can also save = -oA FILENAME   combines -oN, -oG, -oX   for normal grep and xml
--------------------------------
script kiddie = useless

- can save output of scan nmap -sS 127.0.0.1 -oS FILENAME
------------------------------------------------
-sV				determine service/version info on open ports
-sV --version-light		try the most likely probes (2)
-sV --version-all		try all available probes (9)
-O				detect OS
--traceroute			run traceroute to target
--script=SCRIPTS		Nmap scripts to run
-sC or --script=default		run default scripts
-A				equivalent to -sV -O -sC --traceroute
-oN				save output in normal format
-oG				save output in grepable format
-oX				save output in XML format
-oA				save output in normal, XML and Grepable formats
