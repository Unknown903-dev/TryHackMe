Burp Suite Basics

Burp suite = java based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting we apllication penetration testing
Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server

- standard tool for hands on security assessments of web and mobil appllication
- like those that rely on api = application programming interfaces
- By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various 
  components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections.
- The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before
  they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.

Burp suites come in many edition 
- we focus on Burp suite community edition 
- freely accessible for non-commercial use with legal boudaries 
- note: Burp suite also offer professional and enterprise editions which come with advanced features and require licensing

1. Burp Suite Professional is an unrestricted version of Burp Suite Community. It comes with features such as:

- An automated vulnerability scanner.
- A fuzzer/brute-forcer that isn't rate limited.
- Saving projects for future use and report generation.
- A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.
- Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.
- Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).

- Burp Suite Professional is a highly potent tool, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the field.

2. Burp Suite Enterprise, similar to community and professional edition

- utilized for continuous scanning 
- It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities,
- similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning.
- other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.
- Due to requiring a license for the Professional and Enterprise editions, we will focus on the core feature set provided by the Burp Suite Community Edition.

Burp suite community offers limited feature compared to professional one.
It provides an impressive array of tools that are valuable for web applications testing 

Key features 
⁃ Proxy 
The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.
⁃ Repeater 
Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
⁃ intruder 
Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
⁃ Decoder 
Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.
⁃ Comparer 
As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
⁃ Sequencer 
Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.
—————————————————————-
Java codebase of Burp Suite facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework's functionality. 
These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter).

Burp Suite Extender module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the
BApp Store, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the Logger++ module can extend the built-in logging functionality of Burp Suite.

Key Points to Understand About the Burp Proxy

- Intercepting Requests: 
  When requests are made through the Burp Proxy, they are intercepted and held back from reaching the target server. 
  The requests appear in the Proxy tab, allowing for further actions such as forwarding, dropping, editing, or sending them to other Burp modules. 
  To disable the intercept and allow requests to pass through the proxy without interruption, click the Intercept is on button.

- Taking Control: 
  The ability to intercept requests empowers testers to gain complete control over web traffic, making it invaluable for testing web applications.

- Capture and Logging: 
  Burp Suite captures and logs requests made through the proxy by default, even when the interception is turned off. This logging functionality can be helpful for later analysis and review of prior requests.

- WebSocket Support: 
  Burp Suite also captures and logs WebSocket communication, providing additional assistance when analysing web applications.

- Logs and History: 
  The captured requests can be viewed in the HTTP history and WebSockets history sub-tabs, allowing for retrospective analysis and sending the requests to other Burp modules as needed.

Notable features Proxy setting

- Response Interception: 
  By default, the proxy does not intercept server responses unless explicitly requested on a per-request basis. The "Intercept responses based on the following rules" checkbox, along with the defined rules, allows for a more flexible response interception.

- Match and Replace: 
  The "Match and Replace" section in the Proxy settings enables the use of regular expressions (regex) to modify incoming and outgoing requests. This feature allows for dynamic changes, such as modifying the user agent or manipulating cookies.
--------------------------------------------

To use the Burp Suite Proxy, we need to configure our local web browser to redirect traffic through Burp Suite. In this task, we will focus on configuring the proxy using the FoxyProxy extension in Firefox.

- install  FoxyProxy Basic extension.
- Access FoxyProxy Options: Once installed, a button will appear at the top right of the Firefox browser. Click on the FoxyProxy button to access the FoxyProxy options pop-up
- Create Burp Proxy Configuration: In the FoxyProxy options pop-up, click the Options button. This will open a new browser tab with the FoxyProxy configurations. Click the Add button to create a new proxy configuration.
- Add Proxy Details: On the "Add Proxy" page, fill in the following values:
	Title: Burp (or any preferred name)
	Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1
	Port: 8080
- Save Configuration: Click Save to save the Burp Proxy configuration.

- Activate Proxy Configuration: Click on the FoxyProxy icon at the top-right of the Firefox browser and select the Burp configuration. 
  This will redirect your browser traffic through 127.0.0.1:8080. Note that Burp Suite must be running for your browser to make requests when this configuration is activated.
- Enable Proxy Intercept in Burp Suite: Switch to Burp Suite and ensure that Intercept is turned on in the Proxy tab.
- Test the Proxy: Open Firefox and try accessing a website, such as the homepage for http://MACHINE_IP/. Your browser will hang, and the proxy will populate with the HTTP request. Congratulations, you have successfully intercepted your first request!

keep in mind 
- When the proxy configuration is active, and the intercept is switched on in Burp Suite, your browser will hang whenever you make a request.
- Be cautious not to leave the intercept switched on unintentionally, as it can prevent your browser from making any requests.
- Right-clicking on a request in Burp Suite allows you to perform various actions, such as forwarding, dropping, sending to other tools, or selecting options from the right-click menu.

-------------------------------------------------
Target tab - does not just have control over the scope of our testing 
has 3 tabs

site map - 
	- allows to map out targeted web appli in tree structure 
	- every page visited on proxy is displayed on site map
	- In Burp Suite Professional, we can also use the site map to perform automated crawling of the target, exploring links between pages and mapping out as much of the site as possible. 
	- Even with Burp Suite Community, we can still utilize the site map to accumulate data during our initial enumeration steps. 
	- It is particularly useful for mapping out APIs, as any API endpoints accessed by the web application will be captured in the site map.
issue definitions - 
	- burp community does not have full vulnerable functionality = can still access a list of all vulnerabilities that the scanner looks for
	- issue defnition provides alist of web vulnerabilities with a description and refernce 
	- can be valuable for referencing vulnerabilities in reports or assisting in describing a particular vulnerability that may have been identified during manual testing
scope setting
	- allows us to control the target scope burp suite 
	- it enables us to include or exclude specific domains/ip to define the scope of our testing 
	- managing the scope, can focus on the web applic we are targeting and avoid capturing unnecessary traffic 
Target tab offers features beyond scoping, allowing us to map out web applications, fine-tune our target scope, and access a comprehensive list of web vulnerabilities for reference purposes.

steps for flag: 

open burp 
go to target > open browser > insert target web applic
find suspicious link = you can tell from the GET command it has a series of letters and numbers

forward 
go to the directory in browser

flag has been found
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Burp Suite also includes a built-in Chromium browser that is pre-configured to use the proxy without any of the modifications we just had to do.

proxy > intercept > open browser

--------------
burp suite on linux as root user or attack box
- error will appear, inability to create sandbox environ 

smart option - 
	: Create a new user and run Burp Suite under a low-privilege account to allow the Burp Browser to run without issues
easy option -
	: Settings -> Tools -> Burp's browser and check the Allow Burp's browser to run without a sandbox option.
	Enabling this option will allow the browser to start without a sandbox. However, please be aware that this option is disabled by default for security reasons. 
	If you choose to enable it, exercise caution, as compromising the browser could grant an attacker access to your entire machine. 
	In the training environment of the AttackBox, this is unlikely to be a significant issue, but use it responsibly.
=---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scoping

- capturing and logging all traffic = inconvenient -> specfic web aplications
- setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite
- can restrict burp to target only web application we want to test
- easy way = switching to target tab, right click on target from list on left, select add to scope
  Burp will then prompt us to choose whether we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select yes.
- to check scope can switch to scope setting sub tab withing the target tab 
- scope setting = control our target scope by including or excludig domains/ip
- if we disable logging for out of scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything
- proxy setting tab > and url is in target scope = there are two = intercept client request 
- cleans up the traffic 
---------------------------------------------------------------
PRoxing http

- When intercepting HTTP traffic, we may encounter an issue when navigating to sites with TLS enabled. 
- For example, when accessing a site like https://google.com/, we may receive an error indicating that the PortSwigger Certificate Authority (CA) is not authorised to secure the connection.
- This happens because the browser does not trust the certificate presented by Burp Suite.

Overcome the issue = manually add portswigger CA certificate

- Download the CA Certificate: With the Burp Proxy activated, navigate to http://burp/cert. This will download a file called cacert.der. Save this file somewhere on your machine.
- Access Firefox Certificate Settings: Type about:preferences into your Firefox URL bar and press Enter. This will take you to the Firefox settings page. Search the page for "certificates" and click on the View Certificates button.
- Import the CA Certificate: In the Certificate Manager window, click on the Import button. Select the cacert.der file that you downloaded in the previous step.
- Set Trust for the CA Certificate: In the subsequent window that appears, check the box that says "Trust this CA to identify websites" and click OK.

now we can visit any tls enabled site without encountering  the certificate error
your browser trusts the PortSwigger CA certificate and securely communicates with TLS-enabled websites through the Burp Suite Proxy.
-----------------------------------------------

real world problem 
- test for XSS
	- burp active > intercept on 
	- turn on burp through browser 
	- insert email and message
	- go on burp replace email with payload
	- select it then ctrl + U = url encode shortcut to make it safe to send
	- forward to send request
