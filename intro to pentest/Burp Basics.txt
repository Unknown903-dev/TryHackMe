Burp Suite Basics

Burp suite = java based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting we apllication penetration testing
Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server

- standard tool for hands on security assessments of web and mobil appllication
- like those that rely on api = application programming interfaces
- By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various 
  components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections.
- The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before
  they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.

Burp suites come in many edition 
- we focus on Burp suite community edition 
- freely accessible for non-commercial use with legal boudaries 
- note: Burp suite also offer professional and enterprise editions which come with advanced features and require licensing

1. Burp Suite Professional is an unrestricted version of Burp Suite Community. It comes with features such as:

- An automated vulnerability scanner.
- A fuzzer/brute-forcer that isn't rate limited.
- Saving projects for future use and report generation.
- A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.
- Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.
- Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).

- Burp Suite Professional is a highly potent tool, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the field.

2. Burp Suite Enterprise, similar to community and professional edition

- utilized for continuous scanning 
- It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities,
- similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning.
- other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.
- Due to requiring a license for the Professional and Enterprise editions, we will focus on the core feature set provided by the Burp Suite Community Edition.

Burp suite community offers limited feature compared to professional one.
It provides an impressive array of tools that are valuable for web applications testing 

Key features 
⁃ Proxy 
The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.
⁃ Repeater 
Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
⁃ intruder 
Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
⁃ Decoder 
Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.
⁃ Comparer 
As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
⁃ Sequencer 
Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.
—————————————————————-
Java codebase of Burp Suite facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework's functionality. 
These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter).

Burp Suite Extender module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the
BApp Store, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the Logger++ module can extend the built-in logging functionality of Burp Suite.

Burp community edition - Dashboard 

⁃ Tasks:
The Tasks menu allows you to define background tasks that Burp Suitewill perform while you use the application. In Burp Suite Community, the default “Live Passive Crawl” task, which automatically logs the pages visited, is sufficient for our purposes in this module. Burp SuiteProfessional offers additional features like on-demand scans.
⁃ Event log:
The Event log provides information about the actions performed by Burp Suite, such as starting the proxy, as well as details about connections made through Burp.
⁃ Issue activity:
This section is specific to Burp Suite Professional. It displays the vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanner, ranked by severity and filterable based on the certainty of the vulnerability.
⁃ Advisory:
The Advisory section provides more detailed information about the identified vulnerabilities, including references and suggested remediations. This information can be exported into a report. In Burp Suite Community, this section may not show any vulnerabilities.
#############################

Navigation 
⁃ default navigation is primarily done through the top menu bars, which allow you to switch between modules and access various sub-tabs within each module. The sub-tabs appear in a second menu bar directly below the main menu bar.
How it works
⁃ Module selection: 
⁃ The top row of the menu bar displays the available modules in Burp Suite. You can click on each module to switch between them. For example, the Burp Proxy module is selected in the image below.
⁃ 
⁃ Sub-Tabs: 
⁃ If a selected module has multiple sub-tabs, they can be accessed through the second menu bar that appears directly below the main menu bar. These sub-tabs often contain module-specific settings and options. For example, in the image above, the Proxy Intercept sub-tab is selected within the Burp Proxy module
⁃ 
⁃ Detaching Tabs:
⁃ If you prefer to view multiple tabs separately, you can detach them into separate windows. To do this, go to the Window option in the application menu above the Module Selection bar. From there, choose the "Detach" option, and the selected tab will open in a separate window. The detached tabs can be reattached using the same method.

⁃ Keyboard shortcuts
Ctrl + Shift + D Dashboard
Ctrl + Shift + T Target tab
Ctrl + Shift + P Proxy tab
Ctrl + Shift + I Intruder tab
Ctrl + Shift + R Repeater tab
###############################
Options
There are 2 types of settings
⁃ Global settings = known as user settings
⁃ Project settings

• Global Settings: These settings affect the entire Burp Suite installation and are applied every time you start the application. They provide a baseline configuration for your Burp Suiteenvironment.
• Project Settings: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note that Burp Suite Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close Burp.
Top navigation bar you can click settings and it open a separate settings window

In the Settings window, you will find a menu on the left-hand side. This menu allows you to switch between different types of settings, including:
