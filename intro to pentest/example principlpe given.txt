confidentiality
- data protection against illegal access and misuse
- safeguard data from being accessed by parties for whom it was not intended
- example: employee records, accounting documents, etc

integrity = 
- unless approved alterations are made
circumstance under which information is kept correct and consistent
- information remains constant during storage, transmission, and use without involving alteration to the information
- cannot be altered by unauthorized people
- access control and strict authentication can assist in preventing authorized users from making modifications
- hash verifications and digital signatures can assist in ensuring that transactions are genuine and that files have not been altered or corrupted.

Availability = 
- should be available when authorised users need to access it
- key benchmark for an organisation
- reliable and well-tested hardware for their information technology servers
- redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
- well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack

Determine level of access
1) An individual's role/function within the organisation
2) sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

concepts used to assign access rights 
1) Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
• to convert a user's role within an organization into a system access role
2) Privileged Access Management (PAM)
• management of a system's access role's privileges
• enforcing security policies such as:
-- password management
-- auditing policies
-- reducing the attack surface a system faces

The Bell-La Padula Model
- achieve confidentiality
- allowing access to data ONLY to those who have a NEED to know
- "no write down, no read up"
- popular for "government" and "military" since background checks were performed prior to hire and a certain amount of trust occurs
Pros:
- can be replicated to real-life organisations
- simple to implement and understand
Cons:
- although the user may not have access to an object, they will be aware of its existence (not so confidentiality)
- depends on a high level of trust inside the organization

Biba Model
- similar to the Bell-La Pandula model, but with a focus on "integrity"
- applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users)
- no write up, no read down
- use when integrity is more important than confidentiality
Pros:
- simple to implement
- addresses the Bell-La Padula model's shortcomings by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity
Cons:
- many levels of access and objects
- easily overlooked when applying security controls
- results in delays within a business
Example:
- a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model
- developers in software development may only have access to the code required for their job. They may not require access to vital information, such as databases, etc.

Similar to risk assessment
1) Preparation
2) Identification
3) Mitigations
4) Review

STRIDE
Spoofing identity
- authenticate requests and users accessing a system
- malicious party falsely identifying itself as another
- remedy method: Access Keys or Signature
Tampering with data
- help provide integrity to the data
- data must kept integral and accurate
Repudiation threats
- use of services such as logging of activity for a saystem or application to track
Information disclosure
- must only show revelation information to the owner only
Denial of Service
- attacker uses up system resources.
- system should be able to handle and will not cause the business to crash
Elevation of privileges
- worst case scenaro
- attacker tend to further exploit or information disclosure


6 phases of Incident Response
1) Preparation
- Have the resources and plans in place to deal with the incident?
2) Identification
- The threat and threat actor been correctly identified?
3) Containment
- The threat/incident contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?
4) Eradication
- Remove the active threat
6) Recovery
- Perform a full review of the impact system
- Return business as usual
Lessons Learned
- What can be learnt from the incident?
- If phishing email >> employee should be trained better to detect
