IDOR = for Insecure Direct Object Reference and is a type of access control vulnerability.

this vulnerability can occur when web server recieves user supplied input to retrieve objects(files/data/docs)
to much trust on input data, and it is not validated on the server side to confirm the object belongs to user requesting it

1st = changing the value type of website data can be dicovered
---------------------------
Encoded IDs
 passing data from page to page either by post data, query strings, or cookies = developers take data and encode it 

encoding makes the recieving web server understand the content
----
encoding changes binary data into ASCII string commonly use = a-z A-Z 0-9 and "=" for padding 
most common encoding technique on web is base64 encoding 

https://www.base64decode.org/ to decode the string, then edit the data and re-encode it again using https://www.base64encode.org/ and then resubmit the web request to see if there is a change in the response.
--------
hashed IDs = they follow predictable pattern such as being the hashed version of the integer value
It's worthwhile putting any discovered hashes through a web service such as https://crackstation.net/

common use for hash ids = md5
--------------
Unpredictable IDs
Another method is to create 2 accounts and swap id numbers between them 
if you can view the other user content using id number while still logged in with a differ account or not logged in at all 
you found a valid idor vulnerability 
---------------
vulnerable endpoint your targeting may not always be something you see in the address bar 
could be content your browser loads in AJAX request or something you find referenced in a javascript file

endpoints can have unreferenced parameter that have been of some use during development and got pushed to production
ex:
notice a call /user/details = displaying user info 
in attack known as parameter mining you discover a parameter called user_id = display other users info 
ex: /user/details?user_id=123

go to deveopler tool
networks 
headers on top has the website to go to 
and can tamper with id numb
